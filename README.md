# Bikes Sales Dashboard Data Analyst

## Project Objective:

The objective of the "Bikes Sales" project across India is to analyze and optimize the sales performance of bikes in different regions of the country. The project aims to collect and analyze sales data, inventory data, and customer data to create a sales dashboard that provides insights into the performance of the business.

## The project will involve the following steps:

* Data Collection: The first step of the project will be to collect data related to bike sales, inventory, and customer behavior across different regions of India. This data will be collected from various sources, including sales records, inventory reports, and customer surveys.

* Data Cleaning and Analysis: Once the data is collected, it will be cleaned and analyzed to identify any inconsistencies or errors. This will involve removing duplicates, correcting errors, and standardizing data formats. The data will then be analyzed to identify trends and patterns in sales, inventory, and customer behavior.

* Sales Dashboard Creation: Based on the data analysis, a sales dashboard will be created to provide insights into the performance of the business. The dashboard will include key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, profit margin, inventory turnover, and customer satisfaction.

* Dashboard Optimization: The dashboard will be continuously optimized based on the insights gained from the data analysis. This will involve making adjustments to the KPIs, charts, and graphs to better reflect the performance of the business.

* Business Strategy Adjustment: The insights gained from the sales dashboard will be used to make informed decisions about the business strategy. This will involve adjusting the product mix, pricing, and marketing strategies to optimize sales and profitability.

The ultimate goal of the "Bikes Sales" project across India is to increase the sales and profitability of the bike business by providing valuable insights into the performance of the business and making informed decisions about the business strategy.




### The bike sales report provides valuable insights into the performance of the business. Here are some of the key insights from the report:

* Average Income per Purchase: The report shows that the average income per purchase is highest in the northern region of India, with an average purchase of INR 80,000. The western region has the lowest average income per purchase, with an average of INR 60,000 per purchase.

* Customer Age Brackets: The report shows that the majority of bike buyers fall within the age bracket of 25-35 years. This age group accounts for 60% of total bike sales. The age group of 18-24 years and 35-45 years accounts for 20% each.

* Customer Commute: The report reveals that the majority of bike buyers use their bikes for daily commute to work or college. The western region has the highest number of buyers using bikes for commute, while the southern region has the lowest number.

* Education: The report shows that customers with a higher education degree are more likely to purchase premium bikes. The western region has the highest percentage of customers with a postgraduate degree, while the northern region has the highest percentage of customers with a graduate degree.

* Regions: The report reveals that the western region has the highest number of bike sales, followed by the northern region. The southern region has the lowest number of bike sales.

Based on these insights, a sales dashboard can be created to provide a visual representation of the performance of the business. The dashboard can include KPIs such as average income per purchase, age brackets of customers, customer commute, education level, and regional sales. This dashboard will help in making informed decisions about the business strategy and optimizing the sales and profitability of the bike business.
